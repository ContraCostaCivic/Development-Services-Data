# Development-Services-Data
Visualize and interpret data from Walnut Creek’s permitting and entitlement process.

More than 11,000 visitors come to our Development Services Center every year. The City processes more than 2400 applications for Building Permits (our most popular permit type) and City Inspectors complete more than 12,000 inspections annually. We have lots of data like this about the various city functions involved in real estate development within Walnut Creek. What we don’t have is a central dashboard where we can visualize our key performance indicators and answer broader questions like, “What’s the average length of time it takes to get different kinds of permits?” and “What are the trends in permit types year over year?” We will share several Excel sheets with our tracked information with you, along with a log-in to a demo site in Tableau should you wish to use that for visualization. If a tool is developed, it will be used at our regular Development Services Team meetings to review our performance and set goals as well as shared with our development community to help enhance their experience.
